          The forest is my favorite place to be. That's what brought me to
          Colorado in the mid 1990's, and that's what brought me back to
          Colorado in 2018, with my family. Being a father is, to me, the most important job I will ever have. I believe this because it is my responsibility to ensure they are able to support themselves one day, but also because it is my responsibility to humanity to raise a responsible, intelligent, caring, productive member of society. I am originally from a small town in northern Indiana where hardwork and family are a way of life and I still carry those basic values with me today. Adventures with my family are my reward for hard work and planning, and the dreams of many more adventures are what drive me every day. <br /><br />
            I returned to college in the fall of 2013, 23 years after a less than stellar first attempt at the age of 18. It was difficult to manage being a father of two small children, my job as a cnc machinist, and attending school part time. But, I persevered and graduated with a bachelors degree in Business Administration from the same university where I failed 23 years earlier. I didn't have all of the math fresh in my head like I did when I was 18. So, relearning algebra, calculus, and statistics required hours of study. But it taught me I was capable of learning and excelling, and that I didn't have to just hope something good would come my way, I could go find it.
